# REST-API-in-Go

This code first imports the   fmt   and   net/http   packages. The   fmt   package provides functions for formatting text and printing it to the console, while the   net/http   package provides functions for creating and serving HTTP servers. The   main   function first creates a handler function for the   /hello   endpoint. This handler function simply prints the text decribing the maker to the HTTP response writer. The   main   function then calls the   http.ListenAndServe   function to start the HTTP server. This function takes two arguments: the port number on which to listen for connections, and a handler function that will be called for each incoming request. When a client makes a request to the   /hello   endpoint, the   http.ListenAndServe   function will call the handler function, which will print the text decribing the maker to the HTTP response writer.
